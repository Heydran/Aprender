	// Place your snippets for javascript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Get a element by ID": {
		"prefix": "gid",
		"body": [
			"document.getElementById($1)$2"
		],
		"description": "Get a element by ID"
	}
	,
	"Var in Text": {
		"prefix": "vit",
		"body": [
			"`${$1}`"
		],
		"description": "Simple  text with a var"
	}
	
}
